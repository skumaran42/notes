\chapter{Pair of Linear Equations in Two Variables}

\begin{outline}
    \1 A pair of linear equations in two variables $x$ and $y$ can be represented algebraically as follows:
    \begin{align*}
        a_1x + b_1y + c_1 &= 0 \\
        a_2x + b_2y + c_2 &= 0
    \end{align*}
    where $a_1, a_2, b_1, b_2, c_1, c_2$ are real numbers such that $a_1^2 + b_1^2 \ne 0, a_2^2 + b_2^2 \ne 0$.
    \1 Graphically, or geometrically, a pair of linear equations
    \begin{align*}
        a_1x + b_1y + c_1 &= 0 \\
        a_2x + b_2y + c_2 &= 0
    \end{align*}
    in two variables represents a pair of straight lines which are
        \2 interesecting, if $\frac{a_1}{a_2} \ne \frac{b_1}{b_2}$
        \2 parallel, if $\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{b_1}{b_2} \ne \frac{c_1}{c_2}$
        \2 coincident, if $\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{b_1}{b_2} = \frac{c_1}{c_2}$
    \1 To solve a pair of linear equations in two variables graphically, we first draw the lines represented by them.
    \2 If the pair of lines interesect at a point, then the pair of equations is said to be \textit{consistent} and the coordinates of the point provide a unique solution.
    \2 If the pair of lines are parallel, then the pair of equations is said to be \textit{inconsistent}; it has no solution.
    \2 If the pair of lines are coincident, then the pair of equations is said to be \textit{dependent} (\textit{consistent}); it has infinitely many solutions.
    \1 To solve a pair of linear equations in two variables algebraically, we can use:
    \2 Substitution Method
    \2 Elimination Method
    \1 If 
    $
    \begin{aligned}
        a_1x + b_1y + c_1 &= 0 \\
        a_2x + b_2y + c_2 &= 0
    \end{aligned}
    $
    is a pair of linear equations in two variables $x$ and $y$ such that
    \2 $\frac{a_1}{a_2} \ne \frac{b_1}{b_2}$, then the pair of equations is consistent.
    \2 $\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{b_1}{b_2} \ne \frac{c_1}{c_2}$, then the pair of linear solutions is inconsistent.
    \2 $\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{b_1}{b_2} = \frac{c_1}{c_2}$, then the pair of linear equations is dependent and consistent.
