\begin{outline}
    \1 A polynomial in variable $x$ is of the form $$f(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n - 1}x^{n - 1} + \dots + a_1x + a_0$$where $x$ is a variable, $n$ is a positive integer and $a_0, a_1, a_2,\dots,a_n$ are constants.
    \1 The exponent of the highest degree term in a polynomial is known as its degree.
    \1 The names and forms of various degree polynomials:\\\\
    \begin{tabular}{|c|l|l|}
        \hline
        Degree & Name of the polynomial & Form of the polynomial \\
        \hline
        0 & Constant polynomial & $f(x) = a$, $a$ is a constant. \\
        1 & Linear polynomial & $f(x) = ax + b, a \ne 0$ \\
        2 & Quadratic polynomial & $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c, a \ne 0$ \\
        3 & Cubic polynomial & $f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d, a \ne 0$ \\
        4 & Biquadratic polynomial & $f(x) = ax^4 + bx^3 + cx^2 + dx + e, a \ne 0$ \\
